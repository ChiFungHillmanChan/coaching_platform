Problem framing:\n   - Beginners need a simple way to track daily money; existing apps are too complex.\n   - Minimal viable needs: add record, view records, compute totals.\n\n2. Solution design:\n   - API / pages:\n     - `GET /` ‚Üí list records and show stats.\n     - `POST /add` ‚Üí add income or expense.\n   - Table: `records(id, amount, type, note, created_at)`.\n   - Frontend: simplest HTML form.\n\n3. Minimal implementation (MVP code).\n   - Provide a Flask + SQLite skeleton that runs, accepts entries, and updates stats live.\n\n4. Tests:\n   - Add an expense and check the list updates.\n   - Add an income and check the balance.\n   - Restart the app and verify data persists (SQLite).\n\n5. Risks & rollback:\n   - Dropping the table loses data ‚Üí back up `app.db`.\n   - Invalid numeric input by beginners ‚Üí add basic validation (numbers only).\n"

Value proposition:\n   - **Log in one field**: complete a record with minimal steps.\n   - **Zero learning curve**: first screen accepts amount; category and tags optional.\n   - **Instant feedback**: see today/week spend and balance at a glance.\n\n2. User stories:\n   - As an office worker, I want to log breakfast in 10 seconds without breaking flow.\n   - As a student, I want a month-end view of spend per category (food, transit, etc.).\n   - As a power user, I want CSV export for simple analysis.\n\n3.

Why it matters:\n   - Programs often **repeat actions**. A for loop automates repetition without duplicating code.\n   - Examples: iterate a list, process files, inspect characters in a string.\n\n2. Minimal example:\n```python\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(\"Hello\", i)\n```\nOutput:\n```\nHello 0\nHello 1\nHello 2\n```\n   - Explanation: `range(3)` yields [0, 1, 2], so the body runs three times; `i` is the current number.\n\n3. Exercises:\n   - A: Use a for loop to **square** each number in `[2, 4, 6]` and print them.\n   - B: Write a for loop that prints each character in `Python`.\n\n4. Self-check:\n   - Do you know the difference between `for i in range(5)` (0‚Äì4) and `for num in [10, 20, 30]` (iterates list elements)?\n   - Can you explain why the loop variable can be any name (not necessarily `i`)?\n\n5. Extensions:\n   - Task A: Sum numbers 1..100 with a for loop.\n   - Task B: Then use `sum(range(1, 101))` and compare brevity.\n   - Thought: for loops are flexible, but prefer built-ins when available for cleaner code.\n"

Metrics for Validation\n   - Problem‚Äìsolution fit:\n     - ‚â• 20 deep interviews; ‚â• 70% say \"need something faster than Excel\".\n   - Early PMF signals:\n     - ‚â• 40% log ‚â• 5/7 days in week one.\n     - Week-2 retention ‚â• 30%.\n   - Growth signals:\n     - Invite-friend install rate ‚â• 15%.\n     - Premium conversion ‚â• 5%.\n\n6.
